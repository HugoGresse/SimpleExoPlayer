# SimpleExoPlayer
A simple ExoPlayer implementation for easy use [WIP]

Usage

The [demo app](https://github.com/HugoGresse/SimpleExoPlayer/tree/master/demo).

To shorten it, you can either use [`SimpleExoPlayer`](https://github.com/HugoGresse/SimpleExoPlayer/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/io/gresse/hugo/simpleexoplayerdemo/BasicFragment.java) or the [`ExoplayerView`](https://github.com/HugoGresse/SimpleExoPlayer/blob/master/demo/src/main/res/layout/fragment_exoplayerview.xml)

Download
--------

Using Gradle:
```
compile ('io.gresse.hugo.simpleexoplayer:library:0.1.2@aar') {
        transitive = true;
    }
```
